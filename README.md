# 10minmail.py
### Just what *you* need
##### _to know to run this damn file._


This is a command-line python client which generates an email address that lasts 10 minutes. It is not traceable back to you. It is a wrapper on the WebSocket endpoint exposed by this [disposable e-mail service](https://dropmail.me/en/).

# *PYTHON 3*

`pip install websocket-client`

`python3 10minmail.py`

It will then copy the resulting email to your clipboard
<br>
Any messages recieved will be printed to stdout.
